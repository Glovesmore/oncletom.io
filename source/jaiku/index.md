[Jaiku](http://jaiku.com/) is great competitor to [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com). I bet on its scalability to exceed the slowing down Twit-machine. For this purpose, I created this widget with an easy to use interface.

<!--more-->

*   displays the timeline of your choice :

    *   public timeline
    *   contacts timeline
    *   only you

*   message icon (even custom Jaiku's ones)
*   message formatting (auto URL, auto reply)
*   tabed and paginated navigation
*   ability to filter your own messages from display (nice for _contacts timeline_)
*   ability to change your location while sending a message
*   ability to auto-fill your reply message (with _@username_ / _#channel_)

**This widget has been discontinued due to both dropped support from Google and API change**.

What I plan(ed) to do:

*   **better handling of errors****
**
*   **better handling of sending message process**
*   **distinguish people** you follow from people you don't follow (public timeline)
*   distinguish unread Jaiku messages (since first load of the widget)
*   [is.gd](http://is.gd)/[tinyUrl](http://tinyurl.com) implementation (on demand or auto)
*   l10n (localization) in French
*   [Microformats](http://microformats.org/) implementation (_hCalendar_, _hAtom_, _hCard_)
*   repost messages to Twitter
