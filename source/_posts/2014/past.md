**2013 has been *even less* predictable than the past years**.
The only event I could have predicted is I would turn thirty years old.

[Leaving France to London was not part of any plan](https://oncletom.io/2013/every-day-is-a-brand-new-place/).

This blog post is part of 2014’s New Year triptych:
- **Past — Year of the Truth**
- Present — Self-awareness Thirties (yet to be published)
- Future — The Plan (yet to be published)

2013 has been another year full of destructuring for a better regeneration. On top of the legacy, not against it.






## Finding a New Place



## Finding a New Identity

- through looking in the past
- new
- through revealed friendships
- biggest caveat: not having the same word palette as in French, thus blocking my mind when trying to express myself with details

## Finding a New Balance

- Everything I did was normal to me, and I aknowledge everybody around me is better than me.
- Hurt some people.
- Pushed the letting-go to the state of unlearning self-organisation
- it’s about getting back the self-confidence

> Away from the place I built my reputation, projects and personnality.

## Habbits

- Had to recreate them. Carrying them overseas.
- [Same Place, Everyday](http://everyday.oncletom.io) helped me, acting as a fuse between my consciousness and the routine
- Keeping efforts on environmental impacts (local products, preferably organic)

## Culture as a Catalyst

## Attending Conferences

- Reasons to and the sketching
- Glad to have learned the basics of sketching
- Travelling again, external landscapes, the “adventure”

## Photography

- first developed film
- first printed photography film
- night courses helped me connecting the dots, figuring out intuitions

## Back to School

## Time, Loops and Patterns

- (re)discovered “In C” from Terry Riley.
- back to minimalism
-

## Coding Frenzy

- small iterations all the time, there is no big feature

## From Individuality to Community

## And Now?

To be continued.

It has been really about the **truth**. Capabilities. Resilience. Envisionning again.
