I always considered turning thirty years old would be just a symbolic change. Two beautiful digits and nothing more. A **continuity**.

For some reason, it appears to be both a **keystone** in one’s life and an excellent moment **to bounce**. But where? And why?

## tl;dr

This blog post is part of a 2014’s New Year triptych:

1. [Past — Year of the Truth](/2014/past/)
1. **Present — Self-awareness Thirties**
1. Future — The Plan (yet to be published)

You will read how I believe the journey to the thirties happened and brought me slowly but surely in this actual state of mind.

This is why it’s written as a mirror of [the Past](/2014/past/).

## Home & Town

My parents moved a couple of times before I got 6 years old. They *definitely* settled in Bordeaux when I turned 12. Since then, I  moved two times within an area of 18 kilometers in 18 years.

I now recall **we need *time* to reset our body clock**: habbits, mental cues and social network. By social network, I mean people you can trust, rely on and build at a scale you all agree with.

Therefore, the local cultures is a membrane to access this tate of **being home**. The *local culture* includes the spoken languages as it conveys the myths and knowledge shared by a majority of citizens.

Now I’m living at home, abroad my hometown. **By living I mean taking part and giving to the communities I’ve chosen to be part of**. I also feel I could live wherever is possible in the world, as long as I can *bridge my local culture(s) with the local cultures*.

## Identity & Individuality

Thirty is a beautiful number. It feels like the age of maturity, whereas the previous decades could described as following:

1. from 0 to 10 y/o: discovering the **social & living world**.
1. from 10 to 20 y/o: discovering the **outer world**.
1. from 20 to 30 y/o: discovering the **inner world**.

By *social and living world*, I mean the interactions with other people, kids, adults and parents. A wide majority of later events will be highly influenced by what has been experienced at that time, either in good or bad. Try and twist your mind whatever you want, **this is deeply rooted in your brain**.

By *outer world*, I mean the world out of the house and its close boundaries (school, friends, activities). These places are decided for you if you are lucky enough to be mentored by adults.

By *inner world*, I mean the world as you start conceiving it in your mind, by litterally absorbing the knowledge around. **The twenties is this decade you do stuff mostly by instinct**, even if you feel being in total control of yourself.

At thirty years old, I now admit this feeling of freedom, of choosing my life according to my desires, is in reality a pure self-programming consequence resulting from a secret agreement between my body and my brains during the first decade. The external environment shaped my knowledge and my reactions through life experiences.

That’s not *grandiose* neither poetic but realistically, it just helped me moving on situations which severely broke my ideals. 

As mentioned before, **I now assume being a foreigner**.

Through friends and family experience, I also know that **I can become a foreigner for my own native country** if I stay away for a certain amount of time. From another point of view, **I** might not be able to cope again with a culture which became partially unknown to me.

**I have always worked with *content***.

And I feel more and more comfortable everyday.

Deprived of being myself due to external constraints.

## Balance & Consistency

I am building things in the continuity of past experiences, either success or failures.

I had a tendency to wipe off to start again. It costs a lot of efforts plus you never really clear out the past. I now assume building *on top of* past experiences. Acceptance rather than cartesianism.

## Culture & Knowledge

I am a creative person using code for another purpose than the code itself.

I can easily have ideas, adjust them and not willing to push them absolutely to an end. They can be merged and lead to other and more interesting ideas. And projects.

The downside is it can be tiring, and it requires efforts to distract my own mind.

Reading and writing.

## Photography & Creativity

Repetitive patterns. Lines. Cutting/slashing.

I feel I need to expand, towards music and other crafts.


## Goals & Motivations

I know and assume what motives me in life. Figuring out something which might sound obvious is, well, not that obvious in fact. Because we need to answer the *why* question.

In sync with my core values.

Focused.

Not working with a negative impact on a local and a wider balance. I could have written *national* but I don’t want to hurt my *neighbour* too.

## It’s All About Time

I start witnessing my body aging. The first decade of decay while reaching its momentum, or perhaps during the fourties.

Time is limited, and never granted.

I’m not building softwares. I’m building trust and confidence.
