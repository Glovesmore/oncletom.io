One would **never expect their startup to fail 6 months after** having raised half a million of Euros. It eventually happened to me, as the CTO of Dijiwan, a former *digital marketing startup* based in *Bordeaux*, France.

## tl;dr

A good product idea and a strong technical team are not a guarantee of a sustainable business.

One should not ignore the business flow of a company because *it is not their job*. It can eventually deprive them from any future in that company.

## Why Writing About It Only Now?

Success and failure are bound to Time.
And Time flows differently whereas you are in a rising or an abyssal phase.

1. We initiated the Dijiwan project around September 2010;
1. We initiated the Dijiwan startup around September 2011;
1. Dijiwan raised **0.5M€ in January 2011** to develop its business within a year;
1. Dijiwan started struggling to emit **paychecks in July 2012**;
1. Dijiwan requested the bankruptcy protection in September 2012;
1. Dijiwan bankruptcy protection got accepted in December 2012;
1. Dijiwan reached the **bankruptcy stage in March 2013**.

Why writing that side of the story a year after the bankruptcy? Why not sooner?

*Now* is a good moment.
Prior to now, I would have put too much emotions in the analysis. It could have been perceived as some sort of revenge or an easy backstab on a rotting corpse.

One needs time to step back and to acknowledge their own failures.

## Gut Feeling

I remember my first conversation with the CEO of the company: *it went directly to the bin of my memory*. Too many buzzwords. Too much flattery. Nothing much, really.

I learned about that the second time we met, as I did not recognise him while he did recognise me.

The dating continued a couple of times more: I was definitely attracted by the innovation of the product (*mining and mapping networks of Web content*).
I was not convinced by the CEO… but well, as the idea was to raise money, I decided to ignore my gut feeling and to aim at success.

Raising the money equaled building a dream team in ideal conditions. I could not believe it could not work.

## Raising Money Arises Ego Problems

> I want to make sure you do not need that money.

## Big Customers = Lots of Time

And you do not have time. But they have the money you want.

The money you do not have is money you do not have.

## Ignoring Problems

## Tech Does Not Solve Business Issues

We built a nice piece of software. But it never got any more customer by polishing a line of code or by adding a new feature.
Because they were never facing people ready to sign a check.

## Choosing The Right Persons

Customers will not sign a check to a person they do not trust.

And so you cannot make money hence that person believes he does.

## Stewardship

A stewart is better than a boss or a regular ol'fashioned 

## Lack of Support

Where are the public funds when a ship is about to crash? Half a million is not enough to care.

They wanted to create jobs. They created pain and let jobs to be destroyed.
