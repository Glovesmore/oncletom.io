One would **never expect their startup to fail 6 months after** having raised half a million of Euros. It eventually happened to me, as the CTO of Dijiwan, a former *digital marketing startup* based in *Bordeaux*, France.

## tl;dr

A good product idea and a strong technical team are not a guarantee of a sustainable business.

One should not ignore the business flow of a company because *it is not their job*. It can eventually deprive them from any future in that company.

## Why Writing About It Only Now?

Success and failure are bound to Time.
And Time flows differently whereas you are in a rising or an abyssal phase.

1. We initiated the Dijiwan project around September 2010;
1. We initiated the Dijiwan startup around September 2011;
1. Dijiwan raised **0.5M€ in January 2011** to develop its business within a year;
1. Dijiwan started struggling to emit **paychecks in July 2012**;
1. Dijiwan requested the bankruptcy protection in September 2012;
1. Dijiwan bankruptcy protection got accepted in December 2012;
1. Dijiwan reached the **bankruptcy stage in March 2013**.

Why writing that side of the story a year after the bankruptcy? Why not sooner?

*Now* is a good moment.
Prior to now, I would have put too much emotions in the analysis. It could have been perceived as some sort of revenge or an easy backstab on a rotting corpse.

One needs time to step back and to acknowledge their own failures.

## Gut Feeling

I remember my first conversation with the CEO of the company: *it went directly to the bin of my memory*. Too many buzzwords. Too much flattery. Nothing much, really.

I learned about that the second time we met, as I did not recognise him while he did recognise me.

The dating continued a couple of times more: I was definitely attracted by the innovation of the product (*mining and mapping networks of Web content*).
I was not convinced by the CEO… but well, as the idea was to raise money, I decided to ignore my gut feeling and to aim at success.

Raising the money equaled building a dream team in ideal conditions. I could not believe it could not work. So **I purposely ignored my judgement**.

## A Startup does not need a 10K Cegid Software

I now wonder why a company without any single customer should aim for such a [heavy software as Cegid](http://www.cegid.co.uk) to run its accountancy.
Especially as a first self-assigned task. Prior to customer hunting.

**Scale when you need to, not *in case of***.

## Terrible Hiring and Management

Each hiring should be tight to objectives, costs and metrics.

- Is the hiring creating cash, is it creating value or is it  
- How do I know if the job is properly done?
- Have we agreed on the contract termination conditions?
- Is the hiring the result of an internal inefficiency or is it required due to work overload?

We were 2 marketing officers, 2 business developers, 1 strategy analyst, 1 researcher contractor and 4 developers when operating at full speed.

If we analyse the figures:
- 2 persons had the responsibility to bring money on board;
- 2 persons had the responsibility to broaden our visibility;
- 2 persons had the responsibility to deliver customer studies and analysis (1 analyst + 1 researcher);
- 5 persons had the responsibility to build the innovation (4 devs and 1 researcher).

Alongside the previous numbers, we fired 2 marketing officer, 1 developer and 2 design contractors.

This is **too much and not enough** at the same time:
- we signed less than 100K€ of contracts;
- we had too many people to produce content, leading to understaffing;
- the high marketing turnovers reveals a strong bottleneck and inefficiency.

One of the failure is clearly the *will to expend* all the money rather than to spend it wisely. A primary objective is to generate more revenues or to sustain the innovation — if it broadens the business reach.

## Reckless Expenses

Barcelona's Mobile World Congress 2012.
I remember seing nice

The cherry on top: we received a massive LED TV screen *to demo the product to customers* on the same month the first paycheck has been rejected.

## Too Many Pilots/Partnerships



## Wrong Stewardship


A stewart is better than a boss or a regular ol'fashioned 

Top down decision no one buys.

## Big Customers = Lots of Time

And you do not have time. But they have the money you want.

The money you do not have is money you do not have.

In May: [1M€ announced for December against the 100K€ of contract signed at the time](http://pepiniere-ecocreative-bordeaux.fr/2012/05/10/3-questions-a-dijiwan/).

## Ignoring Problems

## You Need to Add Value, Not Complexity

We built a nice piece of software. But it never got any more customer by polishing a line of code or by adding a new feature.
Because they were never facing people ready to sign a check.

## Raising Money Arises Ego Problems


Customers will not sign a check to a person they do not trust.

And so you cannot make money hence that person believes he does.

> I want to make sure you do not need that money.

## Pulling the Fire Alarm

## Promising Millions is not a Solution

## Request for Support

## Lack of Support

Where are the public funds when a ship is about to crash? Half a million is not enough to care.

They wanted to create jobs. They created pain and let jobs to be destroyed.

## I Eventually Would Have Been Fired

So I got fired twice.

## Conclusion


It is easier to write that with a step back than acknowledging those informations *before* and *during* a crisis. I hope it will give you some useful insights, as a startup employee or a co-funder.

The same principle applies equally to other type of businesses: small, medium or big company… or even a government agency.

Feel free to share your own experience, especially if you successfully mitigated similar symptoms in your environment!
