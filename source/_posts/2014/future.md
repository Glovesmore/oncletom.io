When we think about it, it takes quite a time to figure out obvious things such as where we come from, who we really are and why we are acting that way.

Then, how can we reuse all that **knowledge about our own self to make plans for the future**?

## tl;dr

This blog post is part of a 2014’s New Year triptych:

1. [Past — Year of the Truth](/2014/past/)
1. [Present — Self-awareness Thirties](/2014/present/)
1. **Future — The Plan**

In this post we will discuss about the combination of the meaning, the time and our own needs. Blended in a word, this could be called the **purpose of living**.

## Tale of a Traveller

31st of December 2013. We stand on a rooftop in Lisbon. People are around, waiting for the fireworks. The mild temperature makes the night easy to bear with a tee-shirt. One of the guests shares his story, how he traveled, his memories from those moments and ends on the fact **it is *now* the right moment to settle down**.
 
I then asked the following question: 
> How do you know this is now **the right moment** to settle down in your home country after having bounced for 10 years around the world?

He smiles and answers **he had learned *enough***. That there is no point at travelling for travelling or at accumulating visas for the sake of nice landscape photographs albums. 
He can now **bring back this knowledge to his home land** and make an **impact around him** thanks to this experience.

## To Build a Home

[David Bruant](https://twitter.com/DavidBruant) once wrote a blog post entitled [Building in Bordeaux]().

Bordeaux is the city in France where I’ve spent 18 years of my life before flying to London the 1st of March 2013. This is where David and I have met, *twice* ; where we have worked together and tightened our bonds.

His words triggered something in my mind as they put a finger on something I was missing at the time: **it is not just about *doing* nor *making*: it is about *building***. And as importantly, **with whom you are building**.

In the two previous blog posts, I deassembled and reassembled the [past](/2014/past/) and [present](/2014/present/).
The goal was not to uncover my life but rather to prepare yourself to this reading, in order to provide an extended background of *how significant the next lines are*.

## To Fork & To Improve

**I really love patterns, lines and loops**. I spend a lot of time observing them everywhere I go. I eventually match them with unrelated domains, like software and organic growth cycles.

You then start to notice patterns within a single domain, like software. This is one of the benefit of bumping into different communities rather than sticking exclusively to one.

I’ve noticed this tendency to **start something new** rather than **to contribute to the existing**. New is shining. New is attractive. New is easier. Existing is more difficult. Existing is understanding. Existing is rewarding.

The benefit of the experience is you can infuse it to strengthen an existing component. Starting something new is like seeding, it takes more time and effort to reach the same stage you originally left.

**Building is contributing**. It is **doing with a meaning**.
And most of my decisions are now regulated by these middle-term and long-term factors. I want to emphasis that during the next ten years.

## To Listen & To Transmit

I explained in the past articles how I naturally organised stuff to gather people so as they can spread *content* and *knowledge* to a broader number of people (newspaper in school, retrogaming website, technical meetups at work etc.).

This has nothing to do with fame. **Of course we want a *reward***. The most basic one is the satisfaction of having done something good. *Good* is not the proper word. **It is the satisfaction to have achieved something matching our values**.

At some point in the lifecycle of this blog I stopped writing about technical stuff. Because **I thought I was not good enough**. Because I started following people way better than me on the technical field. Because at the same time I spreaded my focus on less technical things, and out of the software industry fog of war.

When I joined the [Sud Web conference](http://sudweb.fr) in France in its early stage in October 2010, I did not know that this measure would have given me a very strong direction as of today. Of course organising an event is cool. Of course people say *thank you* at the end. But I wanted to stop, I wanted to quit.

One day I realised I was not organising Sud Web to be thanked or for the sake of happy people’s face — yet it is emotionally rewarding. I wanted to continue because that way, every year, 170 people - **audience, speakers and staff - go back home having learned something insightful**. Because they have met people. **Because every one of them transmits something that did not exist days ago**.

**Even if it is not cutting edge knowledge**.
Even if it is **not a technical knowledge**.
Especially because this is **out of reach as an individual**.

I want to spend the next ten years transmitting **helpful knowledge** at a *human scale*.
And we will go back on the *human scale* notion later because it is fully intended.

## To Understand & To Empower

In the everyday life, a lot of reactions are triggered at an emotional state of judgement: community events, breaking news or a difficult news to cope with. Yes this douchebag puked over JavaScript, yes this douchebag left over 12 employees like an asshole, yes this douchebag dumped you without letting you a single chance to say a word.

**Understanding has such an advantage over reacting**. Where is the problem coming from? Is this acceptable? Any way to fix this, now or later? Can we prevent that to happen again?

All the nice thing we congratulate are the results of a long run effort. A joint effort of several people. It is rarely an outcome of a single dude pale white because of having been exposed for too long to the neon lights of a creepy basement. **Any. Single. Iconic. Person. Has been helped by others**. Period.

To quote [Rich Armstrong](https://medium.com/@richarmstrong) in his brilliant [take over the manager responsabilities](https://medium.com/servant-leadership/3b0e39d87179):

> Good management culture is your immune system against douchebags.

What if we remove the *management* word?

> Good culture is your immune system against douchebags.

I will dedicate the next ten years to infuse a **good culture** in any community I share enough values with. This is how you empower people: by understanding them and by reacting properly. **Simply by being gently helpful**.

## To Explore & To Deepen

How can one understand
Through books and history.

Through journeys to unknown places. Being more proactive at looking for them instead of awaiting some interesting recommandations pops out.

Digging more than surfacing. It conflicts though with the love of bridging disciplines together to benefit from each of them everywhere. Code in photography. Art in life shaping. Traveling in organising events. Etc.


Either tighting more the bonds with people I care about. Being more proactive at generating activities instead of trying to catch up in the rush.

Focus.

## To Craft & To Be Creative

Do more manual crafting: calligraphy, paper work (I’d love to create paper from natural materials), darkroom processing, digital photography programming.

Book on Iceland.

Collaborations.


## To Disconnect & To Reconnect

Connecting with what we've been deviated by being in long-journey commute urban world. Not much time except for consuming.

World is living in an improved human condition. Kings have changed. They are not ruling us. We are buying from them. So there is no reason for them to change this bound with us. And also because they have few choice to survive.


I’ve given up on the idea of *changing the world* or *making an impact*. Especially as it can’t work on an individual basis. Or otherwise it’s like falling again in the hero’s myth.

Enlightened and curious individual.

Groups and communities.

## To Build & To Depart

Staying longer abroad, in London, to develop what has been started. Getting back some benefits of all those efforts.

Maybe. Later. When it will be the good moment and when I’ll want it. Which is far from being the case.

Meanwhile, things can be done remotely. As long as the Internet remains a public resource.

## It’s All About Time

**Time is limited, and never granted**: I started witnessing my body aging. You never care about it until you notice those details. This also helps you making better decisions: **we can only make a limiter number of decisions**. Let’s make the good ones, the ones matching our values.

We will see in ten years how much of this is (still) relevant, and if it was worth spending some time sharing this content with you.

Tonight I will take a picture of myself with an analog medium format camera. The first on a roll of twelve exposures. Every month. For a year. For ten years.

**It is the *pattern* of making a line from dots and bending the line into a circle, into a swhirl… into *myself***.
