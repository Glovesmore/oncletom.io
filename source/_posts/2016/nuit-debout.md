I was curious to spend an hour at [Nuit debout](#) in Paris.
Because usually we are — French people — so prompt at ranting because nothing moves on nor happens.

It is interesting to have a look at the water boiling.

# tl;dr

# Distributed band aid

- legal advice booth
- free food/paid as you can (happy to pay more than I think it would cost — maybe because food was not primary goal? Is there a link between primary motivation and ability to provide/help?)
- medical help

# Experience, emotional and thoughts sharing

- work issues (guy seing colleagues relocated to a sub-branch company with less benefits + top execs being paid more)
- 


- some are really not used to speak, can feel gawky, unstructured

# Myths and illusions

- minister of economy getting more popular although he is one of the artisan of the work law reform (through the proxy of Myriam El Komri) — law which is awful and unpopular —— Roland Barthes et l'homme politique
- illusion public politicians are at work to "save" the country — laws are byproducts of expert

# Conclusion

Separated from each others by our fears of losing what matters socially (a job, a life, social artefacts bridging the two).

*Nuit debout* is an example at scale of reunion, of ideas, of hopes and of cultures and mixity. Where is it heading if we do not have enough spare time beside our busy lives?

I think this is a good cue this reunion lean towards **union** and **cooperation** rather than **competition**. Why one winner? Nah, we all want to win. Cooperation makes all of us to win.

-> using our jobs
-> not our spare time
