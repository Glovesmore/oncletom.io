I started to listen to podcasts only since February 2015. To be honest, I did not like the *word* nor understood what it could bring to me.

It took me only 2 awards at [Al Jazeera hackaton](#) (hi [Basile](#), hi [Alexandre](#)!) and a [stag do ferry trip](#) (hi [Kaelig](#)!) to finally get to the point.

Since then, I (re)discovered and reinvented my relationship with the radiophonic medium.

# tl;dr

I discovered podcasts to be a **great source of enlightenment**. They are *easy to fit* in your every day life. They can be seen as a **complement of your reading, television and radio habits**.

This article might help you to **start with english and french podcasts**… and maybe you will find some **valuable source of knowledge** along the lines.

# podcast = audio + delivery

First of all, the very base definition of a podcast could be the following: **an audio programme, downloadable from the Web**.

Think of an *audio article*, as if your favourite [New Yorker](#) or [the Guardian](#) long reads could be transposed to an audio format programme.
And actually, they both edit podcasts: [the New Yorker Out Loud](#) and [the Guardian Podcasts](#).

> Who?

Podcasts can be edited by **Web based publishers** (e.g.: *On Being* or *JavaScript Jabber*), **brick and mortar organisations** (e.g.: *the London School of Economics*, *the Guardian* or *Harvard University*) and eventually by **radio broadcasters** (e.g.: the *BBC*, *npr* or *France Inter*).

Unlike a radio receiver on which you switch from frequency to frequency in realtime, you **listen to episodes of your choice** and eventually you end up **subscribing to a programme series** to get notified of new episodes The audio experience can be either *online* or *offline* and usually, it lasts in time. Which means you can listen to a programme broadcasted months or years ago the same way as if it would have been aired yesterday.

# Why, when and how to listen to podcasts?

The major benefits of podcasts are their **asynchronous  consumption** and a **per interests subscriptions**. I do not have to care much about when they are aired: my podcast software will download the subscriptions for me (more on the software bit later).

One needs two items to be able to listen to podcasts:
- a **digital device** to enable podcast playback;
- a **headset**… well, to move the sound from the device to your ears.
