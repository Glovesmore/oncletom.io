Campgrounds have the privilege to _travel by remaining at its exact same location_.
If it could speak, it would have many stories to tale.

Especially the one about the book I left at the [Reykjavík Campsite](http://www.reykjavikcampsite.is/).

## tl;dr

Long story made short, **I left a copy of _Le voyageur de l'absolu_ from _Théodore Monod_ on
the main table of the Reykjavík Campsite's reception** between the 30th of August and the
1st of September 2012.

I'd just _like to know_ what is its story since then.


## The Gift

September 2011.

[David Larlet](https://larlet.fr/david/) is leaving France for Japan for a year abroad.
Unlikely, he is the one providing gifts during his farewell party. Because he still needs
to travel even lighter.

This will become the first title I've read from Théodore Monod.

As a side note, [I offered him a copy _Introduction à la pensée complexe_](https://larlet.fr/david/thoughts/#cleverness)
 from _Edgar Morin_. I quite like the fact [he benefited from my underlinings](https://larlet.fr/david/stream/#tw-120861094897127426)
 while reading it.

## Lessons Learned

## Drying Paper


## Chance


## Self-improving

Obviously, I wanted to write in English to increase the chance of finding back the
new owner of the book. It is also a way to improve my fluency and using new
vocabulary and idioms.

I certainly made mistakes writing this post. Every feedback is welcomed.
