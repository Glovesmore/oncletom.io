[Reasons to be Creative 2013](http://reasons.to/) is over. This was my first time. Attending this conference. Going to Brighton. Camping and hiking there.

**I have been happily surprised by the crowd**, and here is why.

## About Reasons to be Creative

[Reasons to be Creative 2013](http://reasons.to/) is a 3 days multi-track yearly conference. It aims to balance between creative design and creative programming.

It has a fairly strong panel of speakers, and even the sponsored talks are proper enough not to be boring. Better, they can be interesting too! (*loved* the Nokia alarm clock ringtone evolution).

## Breaking the Speed of the Metropolis

Attending the conference was also a good way to break the speed of London. This is a subject which bothers me since a couple of weeks, as I struggle catching up with Time, and achieving at doing all I want to do.

**London has almost too many things to offer**.  
And being surrounded by stormy-thinking people does not help to rest.

I left the laptop at home. Turned off the phone. Bought a map and walked for hours in sparsely crowded trails. **It gave me the mood to make pictures**. Which never happens in London.  
[Since I travelled to Iceland](http://www.flickr.com/photos/the-jedi/sets/72157631659580458/), it seems I became picky on my satisfaction at capturing landscape. Again, I realise how beautiful *every single angle* from any viewpoint was.

On monday morning, **I was already rested** and ready to enjoy people talking and sharing their knowledge.
