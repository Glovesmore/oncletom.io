[Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) is growing-up start page with many widgets. The UWA API is fine enough to build a widget once and spread it over many other platforms such as [iGoogle](http://www.google.com/ig), _MacOS X Widgets_, _iPhone_ and some more.

My contributions are **widgets**, i18n ready.

I use [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) as a **one-eye-look dashboard** with all my email accounts, calendars, Facebook, the weather and ... Twitter of course.

Sometimes I work for fun, sometimes because I really miss a widget. It is especially the case with the [Jaiku](http://jaiku.com/)'s widget.
