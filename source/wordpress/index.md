Wordpress is an award-winning blogging software. I use it to power this blog with custom plugins and a custom theme.

My contributions are related to **translations** and **plugins development**.

I use to manage both [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) and [Wordpress Mu](http://mu.wordpress.org/). I will release only parts of code proper for public sharing. It means in plain old words :

*   proper code
*   proper documentation
*   hosted code on [Wordpress.org Plugins](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/) for one-click-updates easing
I will also translate in French all plugins I use that don't have any translation yet. Yes I will ;-)
