## Creativity

I am a creative person using code for another purpose than the code itself.

I can easily have ideas, adjust them and not willing to push them absolutely to an end. They can be merged and lead to other and more interesting ideas. And projects.

The downside is it can be tiring, and it requires efforts to distract my own mind.

## Photography

Repetitive patterns. Lines. Cutting/slashing.

## Consistency

I am building things in the continuity of past experiences, either success or failures.

I had a tendency to wipe off to start again. It costs a lot of efforts plus you never really clear out the past. I now assume building *on top of* past experiences. Acceptance rather than cartesianism.

## Identity

I assume being a foreigner.

And I feel more and more comfortable everyday.

## Goals and motivations

I know and assume what motives me in life. Figuring out something which might sound obvious is, well, not that obvious in fact. Because we need to answer the *why* question.

In sync with my core values.

Focused.

## Being Nobody

An individual within the crowd. You are nothing without the crowd. And the crowd is, something else without you. But still, a crowd.

## Writing

Using a fountain pain again. With a thick black ink. It increases a lot the pleasure of writing.

## Reading

First anonymous parcel containing the book “Soft City”.

## Time

I start witnessing my body aging. The first decade of decay while reaching its momentum, or perhaps during the fourties.

Time is limited, and never granted.
