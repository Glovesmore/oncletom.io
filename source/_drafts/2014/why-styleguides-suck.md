- starting at 39'30 "Always put the search box in the upper right"
- arbitrary rule that does cause user experience problem
- rule-based decisions vs informed decisions
- investment in those rules/
- they never work on the long term (and does not value maintaining them)

> They get stuff out but not good stuff out.

That was their problem. Thought rules would prevent that.

### Rule-based Decisions

Prevents thinking.

Rules don't cover the exceptions. We do things because we are supposed to do them.

And how do you validate them? Can you invalidate them Ã  la jshint?

### Informed Decisions

Requires thinking to make a decision.

We design because to deal with exceptions and constraints.

- Process "we can do do something" - Doing a website
- Methology "we want to do it again and again" - Agile (remember XP should save any project?)
- Dogma "They even have removed table from their house" - Web Standards
- Techniques "Reproducible independant steps" - ESLINT
- Tricks "Techniques which are wrong but which works" - `translateZ()`

Struggling companies have a tremendous of methodology and dogma.

Tips and tricks help solving any problem at any time.

**Design Patterns** are proactive ways of solving problems. Good design in the path of least resistance.

**We can choose** as we have a language we understand.
