## tl;dr

## Gut Feeling

## Raising Money Arises Ego Problems

> I want to make sure you do not need that money.

## Big Customers = Lots of Time

And you do not have time. But they have the money you want.

The money you do not have is money you do not have.

## Ignoring Problems

## Tech Does Not Solve Business Issues

We built a nice piece of software. But it never got any more customer by polishing a line of code or by adding a new feature.
Because they were never facing people ready to sign a check.

## Choosing The Right Persons

Customers will not sign a check to a person they do not trust.

And so you cannot make money hence that person believes he does.

## Stewardship

A stewart is better than a boss or a regular ol'fashioned 

## Lack of Support

Where are the public funds when a ship is about to crash? Half a million is not enough to care.

They wanted to create jobs. They created pain and let jobs to be destroyed.
