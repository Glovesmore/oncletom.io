I am building things in the continuity of past experiences, either success or failures.

I had a tendency to wipe off to start again. It costs a lot of efforts plus you never really clear out the past. I now assume building *on top of* past experiences. Acceptance rather than cartesianism.

## Time Balance

Focusing on *doing* things which matches long-term life plan.

Because when you are curious, it is very easy to spread your time and energy into everything, and getting back frustrated of a low progress.

## Crafting

Do more manual crafting: calligraphy, paper work (I’d love to create paper from natural materials), darkroom processing, digital photography programming.

## Photography

Book on Iceland.

Collaborations.



## Exploration

Through books and history.

Through journeys to unknown places. Being more proactive at looking for them instead of awaiting some interesting recommandations pops out.

Digging more than surfacing. It conflicts though with the love of bridging disciplines together to benefit from each of them everywhere. Code in photography. Art in life shaping. Traveling in organising events. Etc.

## Chaos Control

Trying to be better at organisation. Not planning almost made me dodging from any form of planning or organisation, awaiting the last minute to start putting things down.

Trying to funnel more my thinking efforts by not catching up on distractions or serendipity too often.

## Trusting my Hands

Sketching more often ideas into drawings, as a summary of thoughs and concepts. Easier to share.

## Building

Staying longer abroad, in London, to develop what has been started. Getting back some benefits of all those efforts.

## Writing

Writing more often what my head conveys.

## Human Interactions

Either tighting more the bonds with people I care about. Being more proactive at generating activities instead of trying to catch up in the rush.

## Empowering

I’ve given up on the idea of *changing the world* or *making an impact*. Especially as it can’t work on an individual basis. Or otherwise it’s like falling again in the hero’s myth.

Enlightened and curious individual.

Groups and communities.

## Coming Back

Maybe. Later. When it will be the good moment and when I’ll want it. Which is far from being the case.

Meanwhile, things can be done remotely. As long as Internet remains a public resource.
