**Thomas Parisot** is my full name and people often call me *Tom*.
Hence my long lasting nickname — *Oncle Tom* — a friendly pun to our *digital slavery*.

I am a Frenchman in London: **Web Engineer** at [BBC R&D](http://bbc.co.uk/rd), **curator** of [Sud Web](http://sudweb.fr) and **funder** of the popular [Bordeaux JavaScript Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/BordeauxJS/).

I use Web technologies to *experiment*, to *prototype* and to *empower* people. I fuel that effort with *public speaking*, by organising Sud Web and by publishing content – whether through *words* or through *open source software*.

## Values

I highly believe in **openness**, **craftsmanship** and **sustainability**.

Through my acts, I do not want to create more *unbalance* or to leave a debt behind me.
Hence I will do my best to favour **non-profit**, **ethical** or **greater good** organisations.

## Professional experience

I have **more than 10 years of professional experience** in the Web industry through various roles and responsibilities:

- *Web engineer* at [BBC R&D](http://bbc.co.uk/rd);
- *CTO* and *co-funder* of [Dijiwan, a startup which failed](/2014/why-our-startup-failed/);
- *Web consultant* in my own limited company;
- *Web consultant* at [Clever Age](http://en.clever-age.com/), a renowned French Web engineering agency;
- *Web developer* in a nation-wide retail group.

## Can we get in touch?

Maybe we will meet in the *Underground* by chance.
Maybe we will meet in an exhibition somewhere in Europe.
Maybe we will meet in a backpacker hostel somewhere in the World.

Or maybe [we will simply start with an email](mailto:&#104;&#105;&#064;&#111;&#110;&#099;&#108;&#101;&#116;&#111;&#109;&#046;&#105;&#111; "Contact") ;-)

We can definitely break the ice around a glass of wine or a nice meal.
